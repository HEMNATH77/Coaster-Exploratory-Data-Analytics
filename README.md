# Coaster-Exploratory-Data-Analytics

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process used to investigate and understand the patterns, relationships, and trends within a dataset related to roller coasters. This analysis typically involves summarizing key statistics, visualizing data through plots and graphs, and identifying any anomalies or interesting patterns. The goal is to gain insights into aspects such as coaster speed, height, type, and popularity, which can inform further analysis or decision-making in areas like theme park design, safety improvements, or marketing strategies.</p>

<h2>Process for Visualisations</h2>
<ol><h3>1. Importing the Dataset and Python Libraries</h3>
    <h3>2. Data Preparation</h3>
    <h3>3. Data Cleaning</h3>
    <h3>4. Data Visualisations</h3>
    <ol><h4>Bar Graph</h4>
    <h4>Histogram</h4>
    <h4>Line Graph</h4>
    <h4>Scatter Plot</h4></ol>
    <h3>5. Use of Seaborn </h3>

<h2>Importing the Dataset and Python Libraries</h2>
<p> Import the Python Libraries Such as Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. Download the Dataset from the Kaggle and Import it as a Data Frame in the Jupyter Notebook</p>

<h2>Data Preparation </h2>
<p> From the importing Dataset , Look out the columns and Data. Take the necessary Data that you want to analyse for visualisation.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>In Data Cleaning, Clean the dataset with the duplicate values. These duplicate values can disturb the visualisation process. Renaming the columns with our interest and neglecting the null values in the dataset</p>
